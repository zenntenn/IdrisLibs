Finite types are dependent pairs: an |n : Nat| (the cardinality of the
type) and an isomorphism to |Fin n|. Here we extract the cardinality.

We can represent a finite type |A| of cardinality |n| with a vector of
elements of type |A| of length |n|. This can be done by calling
|FinOperations.toVect| on the finite function associated (via ||) to |A|.
