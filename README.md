# IdrisLibs

This repository is an attempt at restructuring the code developed for
the computation of Sequential Decision Problems (SDPs) in
[SeqDecProbs](https://github.com/nicolabotta/SeqDecProbs) into a
collection of Idris Libraries.

Some related Agda code is available in
[patrikja/SeqDecProb_Agda](https://github.com/patrikja/SeqDecProb_Agda).

With Idris-dev-ff776da, you should be able to type check all the basic
libraries with "make libs" in the top-level repository.

With more recent Idris version some libraries might fail to type check,
please see issues #3405 and #3505 in
[Idris-dev/issues](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/issues).
