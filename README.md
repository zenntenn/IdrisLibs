# IdrisLibs

This repository is an attempt at restructuring the code developed for
the computation of Sequential Decision Problems (SDPs) in
[SeqDecProbs](https://github.com/nicolabotta/SeqDecProbs) into a
collection of Idris Libraries. Some related Agda code is available in
[patrikja/SeqDecProb_Agda](https://github.com/patrikja/SeqDecProb_Agda).

## Type checking

With Idris-dev-71b49d3, you should be able to type check all the basic
libraries by entering "make libs" in the top-level repository. With
Idris 1.0, some libraries fail to type check, please see issue #3727 in
[Idris-dev/issues](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/issues).
